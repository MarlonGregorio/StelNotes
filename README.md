# StelNotes
Share notes to friends and work alongside each other. Transform notes typed in google docs or written down into something with color and proper organization. Export created notebooks or sets of notes as local back-ups or as a means of manual sharing. All notes are created as lists that allow the grouping, rearranging, and ranking of notes. These features and this website is my attempt at creating a more productive study session.

## Frameworks

### Py4web
"PY4WEB is a web framework for the rapid development of efficient database-driven web applications. It is an evolution of the popular web2py framework but much faster and slicker. Its internal design has been much simplified compared to web2py. PY4WEB can be seen as a competitor of other frameworks like Django or Flask, and it can indeed serve the same purpose. Yet PY4WEB aims to provide a larger feature set out of the box and reduce the development time of new apps." -PY4WEB documentation

### Vue.js
"Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries." -Vue.js documentation

### Bulma CSS
"Bulma is a free, open-source CSS framework based on Flexbox and used by more than 200,000 developers. Bulma is also considered a mobile-first framework and optimizes for vertical reading. In the end, Bulma is simply a collection of CSS classes. Write the HTML code you want." -Bulma documentation
